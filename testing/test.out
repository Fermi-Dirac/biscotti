	max_seconds = 28800.0, !!8 hours until timeout
	etot_conv_thr = 1.0D-4, !!total energy in au for ionic minimization. Extensive

	nstep = 50, !! Number of structural optimization steps

&SYSTEM
	nbnd = 16, !! number of bands, likely don't need that many.
	nspin = 1, !! number of spins. 1 for normal, 2 for LSDA, and 4 for weird stuff with magnets
	ecutwfc = 40, !!energy cutoff in Ry, 1 Ry = 0.5 Ha = 13.6057 eV, if you use Ultrasoft, set ecutrho = 10*ecutwfc. Tony uses 40
	occupations = 'smearing', !guassian smearing for metals. 'fixed' is better for insulators, use 'tetrahedra' if you're doing a DOS calc
	exxdiv_treatment = 'gygi-baldereschi', !for Exx with coulumb potential divergance. gygi a4nd vcut is for cubic cells, vcut_ws for anisotropicand and 'none' for q = 0. gygi is default anyways.
	ibrav = 0, !!0 generic, 1, cubic, 2: fcc, 4: Hexagonal, etc.
	degauss = 0.001, !! energy is Ry of smearing
	nat = 2, !!number of atoms in the unit cell
	ntyp = 2, !! number of atomic species in the unit cell

&ELECTRONS
	electron_maxstep = 40, !! Default is 100, fewer steps for fun
	conv_thr = 1.0d-7, !! Convergance threshold for electronic steps
	mixing_mode = 'plain', !! Can also be thomas-fermi screening,
	scf_must_converge = .true., !! Default true, if false, keeps moving ions even if electronic steps fail. Which is weird.
	startingwfc = 'atomic+random', !! atomic, random, both, or file.
	startingpot = 'atomic', !! Could be atomic (normal) or from file for non-self-consistent band stuff
